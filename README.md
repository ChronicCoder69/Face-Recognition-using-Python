# Face-Recognition-using-Python
Simple face recognition system built using python keras

#How it works?
Well for those who are new to concepts of ML/AI, lets just say that there are a set of commands in python grouped together and called Keras which when coupled with another set of commands called Face recognition, magically detect the face of known persons' in a group photo.

#What are the applications of Face Recognition?

An important one is when your mobile phone uses face recognition to unlock!

Other important applications include:
<li>IDENTIFY PEOPLE ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS</li>
<li>PREVENTING RETAIL CRIMES</li>
<li>SMARTER ADVERTISING</li>
<li>FINDING MISSING PERSONS</li>
<li>DIAGNOSE DISEASES</li>

# Building the app:
Lets Start with the basics:
 First you will need to download the zip file and unzip it.

Once done you will need to install the VS Code C++ and python3 for 64-bit:
Use the following link to do the same:

https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
<p>
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.2/python-3.10.2-amd64.exe

Once installed, open your command prompt and enter the following commands:
<li> cd face_rec </li>
<li> pip install -r requirements.txt </li>

This may take several minutes to install, once done open the command prompt again and enter the following commands:
<li> python face_rec.py </li>
It may take a couple of minutes to boot the app up, once ready it will detect the face in the system.
